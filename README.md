These tutorials are supposed to give example use cases for introductory topics in RL using Jupyter Notebooks. All of these examples are taken from the classic \"Introduction to Reinforcement Learning\" by Sutton & Barto 2018. The enivronments used are all from Gymnasium (https://gymnasium.farama.org/).

There are 4 tutorials with the following content:

  - Python_Getting_Started: Intro to Python/Matplotlib/pandas and a how to guide to install dependencies used in the other tutorials.
  - Dynamic_Progamming: Basic Dynamic Programming example using a 'Slippery GridWorld' (https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/).
  - BlackJack_Example: Basic Monte Carlo Evaluation and Control example by playing blackjack (https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/blackjack/#blackjack).
